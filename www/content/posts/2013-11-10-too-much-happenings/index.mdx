I'd post all of them in a collective. When I get to have so much happenings I tend to divert myself to thinking too much. And as I suggested on [my previous post](/blog/everyday-is-a-starting-point/), thinking too much is not a good thing. On the other hand, I'm grateful that most of the things that occur in the past weeks were a blessing.

## Hackathon

## New Employment

I am resigning from my post as a full-time employee on PULP. I'd still be their Webmaster and I'll  be working for them part-time when they just need my help (technical support) and consultation.
