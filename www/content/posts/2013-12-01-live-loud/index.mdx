If you may have read on [my previous entry](/blog/too-much-happenings), I resigned from my full-time position at The Fookien Times Yearbook Publishing Co, the mother company of [PULP Magazine](/project/pulp-magazine-live) and [PULP Live World Production](/project/pulp-live-world). However, I'll still be working part-time as their webmaster.

In this post, I'd like to dedicate some space in summarizing my 2-year experience working at PULP. **LIVE LOUD** is PULP Magazine's tagline.

**Some inside story how I got into PULP... **

Well, I was just browsing my Facebook feed and saw their post that they were looking for web developers to join them. I was not seriously looking for a job that time (I was still in Cavite) and I just tried since I'm into web development. And so I submitted my resume via email and got a prompt response for an interview.

Yikes, I had to travel for about 3 hrs and didn't know exactly where the office was. And I was not familiar with the places on Metro Manila that time because I lived in the province.

But hell to that, I was so excited because if you know me in high school, I am a song hits freak. **Song hits**, if you might remember, is what we call those music magazines with lyrics and guitar chords embedded on them. Although there are lots of open discussions whether song hits are to be considered as music magazines but you get the idea. And also not all of the chords are correct and we all made fun of it. But Internet killed the song hits and you can now easily search for the tabs and video covers on YouTube. Boohoo.

I'm an avid magazine collector. This is a picture of my music magazines and song hits collection back then (lower shelf), together with my books and other stuff (circa 2008):

I was told during the interview that they got lots of resumes piled and they chose mine. Maybe it's the design of the resume that got their attention. It was actually inspired by David Malan's CV. If you are familiar with open courses, David Malan is a professor at [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Extension School. He's my all-time favorite professor, by the way. :)

And so I got hired and...

## The Adventure Began

**11/19/2011** - 4 days after my first day on PULP, I got the opportunity to watch [Children of Bodom Live in Manila](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150376409692896.358750.759167895&type=3&l=8c3042754a%C2%A0). This is a photo taken during the Meet &amp; Greet. Alexi Laiho is looking at me and Jaska Raatikainen is looking at the camera. Good times. Heh.

**11/28/2011** - The 2011 Philippines Yearbook Launch. As you have read above, The Fookien Times is the mother company of the PULP brand. I quite enjoyed this one though, it's a refreshing experience to see what these known people are up to during these type of events. Here's a photo of me with the hardworking ladies of Fookien Times.

**12/09/2011** - [Parkway Drive Live in Manila](https://www.facebook.com/gianfaye/media_set?set=a.10150417917862896.363364.759167895&type=3) is still the liveliest and most fun concert I've ever been to up to this date. These guys are the most humble guys we've met in history. Here's a photo of me with their frontman, Winston McCall.

## 2012

**02/18-19/2012** - This is the start of the most exciting year ever, 2012. I got the opportunity to go with our road managers to assist [Lamb of God and The Black Dahlia Murder](https://www.facebook.com/gianfaye/media_set?set=a.10150561881467896.384435.759167895&type=3) on their concert last Feb. 18, 2012. I can say that this is one of the events I'll remember for the rest of my life. I also got the chance to join them on their after party and watch them do sorts of shit. Funny shit.

### Lamb of God

I wasn't able to take proper photos as I was assigned with the road management of ABR and WCAR - although I fully admit I fail as a road manager. Haha. It was one of those tough experiences I'll always remember.

## Not an Ending

It's quite difficult to merge all the happenings on the span of 2 years within one post. I'm really grateful to be a part of the PULP Crew and this have always been a lifechanging episode.

It is not the number of concerts I've been to or the number of artists I got to see and interact with in real life. What I'll miss the most is the everyday fun of being a part of PULP family.

**LIVE LOUD!**
