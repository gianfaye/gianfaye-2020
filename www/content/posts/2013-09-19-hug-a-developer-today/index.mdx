I happen to chance running into this video from the [WebGeekPH Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgeekph/).

<div class="Image__Small">

  <figcaption>Hug a developer today</figcaption>

A number of developers around the world could relate, not specifically with what they indicated on their boards, but you get the gist.

## What we really need

Of course, it's a video created for fun. But it tackles an important part on the developer workforce and how we wanted to be treated as a developer.

**All I wanted was to get to my desk, code, and finish something.**

I wish I could get every manager to read these books:
- ["Why Programmers Work At Night"](https://leanpub.com/nightowls)
- ["Linchpin" by Seth Godin](http://amzn.to/18ekKGP).

> Creativity is intelligence having fun.

As most of the people didn't know, [programming is a creative endeavor](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/). We are not automated machines, we are [creative](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity/) human beings who enjoy technical challenges and have bills to pay.

We need no hugs, we demand better treatment (and pay). No, we deserve them.

If you can't provide them then you do not deserve us.
